"""A simulated terrain field: procedural relief contoured as editable linework.

Every other rich source in Hipparchus reads data someone downloaded first. This
one generates it, so contour work is reachable on a bare install with no file,
no account, and no network. The field is deterministic in the seed and anchored
to geography rather than to the window: panning shows more of the same
landscape instead of re-rolling a new one, which is what makes the result usable
as a map rather than as wallpaper.

The elevations are **invented**. Everything this module emits is tagged
``synthetic`` so a generated map is never mistaken for measured ground.
