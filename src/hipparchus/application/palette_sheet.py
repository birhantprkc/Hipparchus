Everything here is *derived* rather than chosen, which is the entire argument
for palettes: a colour scheme picked layer by layer drifts, and one obtained by
mixing from a small set cannot. The mixes are the macOS application's, which
took them from the style-pack build script, and they are kept identical for the

be no way to tell which was wrong.
