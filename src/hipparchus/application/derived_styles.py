"""Styles for layers no preset has ever named.

`presets.py` carries sixteen style tables and not one of them mentions
``sst_bands``, ``sst_contours``, ``current_streamlines``, ``ferry_routes`` or
``admin_boundaries``. The tables predate all five, and
``palette_sheet.style_profile`` is the only place that has ever styled them —
so on a sheet drawn from a preset with no ``--palette`` override every one of
them fell through to ``resolve_style``'s last resort.

For the four line layers that is a wrong-coloured hairline. For ``sst_bands``
it is worse: it is a **fill** layer, so the shared default drew the sea
temperature as one flat box with its ramp discarded, which is the whole of what
the layer exists to show. That is the same shape of bug ``derived_depth_bands``
was written to end, and this closes it the same way.

**The mixes are ``palette_sheet``'s own**, read off what the preset itself
already chose rather than off a full palette — the approach
``derived_depth_bands`` and ``derived_seamark_style`` already take, so a preset
without a palette override gets these layers in its own voice rather than in
nobody's.

The profile is duck-typed rather than imported: ``StyleProfile`` lives in
`presets`, which imports this module, and only ``layer_styles`` and
``background`` are ever touched here.
