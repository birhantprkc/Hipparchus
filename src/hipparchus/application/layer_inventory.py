"""What a rendered map actually contains.

The old layer panel was a fixed checklist written before half the layers
existed: it never mentioned contours, summits, bathymetry or earthquakes, and
it claimed the same twenty-three entries whether they held anything or not. An
empty map could not explain itself.

This derives the panel from the scene that was actually built, so a layer with
nothing in it says so rather than sitting there ticked and blank.
