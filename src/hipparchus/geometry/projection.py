#: How far the meridians may converge across a frame before a flat projection

#: Both small-frame projections scale east-west by a single cosine:
#: ``local_azimuthal`` by the cosine of the frame's centre, Web Mercator by
#: stretching north-south with the secant of each latitude. Either way the error
#: across a frame is the ratio between the cosine at its centre and the cosine
#: at its furthest edge, and this is how far that ratio may fall from 1.
#:
#: 0.12 is where the worked examples land either side of the line. Santorini is
#: 0.001 and Greece 0.05, so an island and a small country keep the projection
#: written for them; France is 0.086 and keeps it too. The contiguous United
#: States is 0.18, Europe 0.49 and the world 0.91 -- frames where a reader would
#: see the stretch without being told to look for it. The numbers are measured

#: can be read off its corners.
