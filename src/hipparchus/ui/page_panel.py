"""Page: paper, orientation, resolution, and the SVG's furniture.

The paper drives all three exports, not only the SVG. It is stated in inches,
so pixels are inches x dpi for the PNG, points are inches x 72 for the PDF,
and the SVG keeps taking pixels because that is what a viewport is. A sheet
asked for at 24 x 36 is the same sheet in every format.

The furniture is off by default and asked for per export rather than
remembered as map state -- the map is the product, and nothing here changes
it, which is why none of it lands in the session or in undo.

A mixin rather than a widget class: `_page_spec`/`_canvas_size` are read by
the toolbar's export methods too (`_export_raster`, `_refresh_page_cost`), and
`_canvas_size` reaches into the map canvas's own widget. That coupling
predates this move -- the two were always one conceptual unit, physically
adjacent in the file they came from -- and untangling it is a redesign, not
the pure move this phase is.
