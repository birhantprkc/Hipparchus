"""The scene as data rather than as ink.

Every other export here — SVG, PDF, PNG — is a **picture**. The coordinates in
them are page coordinates, and the ground they came from is gone by the time the
file is written. That is right for the product and wrong as the only door out: a
coastline assembled from EMODnet's 115 m grid, a depth band, a summit placed from
OSM could leave only as a drawing, and a drawing cannot be measured, queried or
joined to anything.

This writes the same scene as RFC 7946 GeoJSON: every vertex unprojected back
into longitude and latitude, every feature naming the layer it came from, and the
per-feature colours the ramp assigned carried in simplestyle-spec keys that other
tools already read. It is the inverse of the step `svg_clean` takes, not new
geometry.

**What it cannot carry is attributes.** A `RenderScene` is the drawing: by the
time a feature reaches a layer its OSM tags have been read, classified and
discarded, and nothing downstream of `scene_builder` has them to give back. What
comes out is shape, layer and style — enough to draw, measure and filter, not
enough to ask what a way was tagged. That means going back to the source, which
is what the source is for.

Ported from `HipparchusMac`'s `Sources/HipparchusRender/GeoJSONExporter.swift`,
which had it first.
